<p class="calibre1">of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be a witness with us of his resurrection.   23 And they appointed two, Joseph called</p>
<p class="calibre1">Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</p>
<p> 429 </p>
<p>   24 And they prayed, and said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all  <i class="calibre3">men, </i> show whether of these two thou</p>
<p>This is a header</p>
<p class="calibre1">hast chosen,   25 That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which</p>
<p class="calibre1">Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.   26 And they gave</p>
<p class="calibre1">forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven</p>
<p class="calibre1">apostles. </p>
